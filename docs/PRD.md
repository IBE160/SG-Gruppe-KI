## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Develop an AI-assisted training companion that provides adaptive daily workout plans, integrated music, and motivational support.
*   Help users achieve their fitness goals efficiently and build lasting consistency.
*   Provide a seamless and integrated user experience, combining training, music, and coaching.
*   Cater to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced trainees.
*   Ensure user control and data privacy through transparent settings and optional data sharing.

### Background Context

Many individuals struggle with workout consistency due to a lack of clear plans, motivation, and integrated tools. Existing fitness apps are often fragmented, separating training, music, and coaching, which hinders long-term habit formation. This project aims to solve that by creating an AI-assisted training companion that combines personalized guidance, habit support, music integration, and a seamless user experience. The goal is to provide a personal training app that generates adaptive daily plans with AI, including training and recovery tips, motivation and music playback, wearable syncing, and progress tracking, ultimately leading to efficient progress and lasting consistency for the user.
