### Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Setup

As a Developer,
I want to initialize the project with Next.js, FastAPI, and Supabase,
So that we have a foundational structure for development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the project structure is defined in architecture.md
**When** the initialization commands are run
**Then** a Next.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a Supabase project are created and connected.
**And** the project is structured as a monorepo.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Technical Notes:** Follow the Project Initialization section in architecture.md. Includes setting up .env files and basic configurations.
