### 1.3. Gamification & Achievements
*   **Description:** A system of badges, trophies, or milestones for various accomplishments.
*   **Examples:** "7-Day Streak," "10-Ton Club" (total weight lifted), "PR Breaker."

## 3. Expanding the "Advisor" Concept

**Focus:** Leaning further into the AI's role as a holistic advisor.

*   **Benefit:** Addresses a critical component of fitness, significantly increasing the app's value proposition.

### 3.2. Educational Content
*   **Concept:** The AI could provide educational snippets, articles, or videos explaining the "why" behind certain exercises or training principles.
*   **Benefit:** Empowers the user with knowledge and builds trust in the AI's recommendations.

### 3.3. AI Personality/Tone
*   **Concept:** A setting that allows the user to choose the AI's coaching style (e.g., "Encouraging Coach," "Drill Sergeant," "Just the facts").
*   **Benefit:** A powerful and unique personalization feature that deepens the user's connection to the app.

## 5. Long-Term Strategic Focus

**Decision:** While all expansion areas are valuable, **Nutritional Guidance** has been selected as the primary long-term focus for expanding the AI's advisory role after the successful implementation of Phase 2. This represents the most significant opportunity for increasing the app's value and holistic impact on the user's fitness journey.

## 6. Deep Dive: AI Playlist Generation

This section details the specific requirements defined for the "Smart Radio" feature.

### 6.1. Seeding & Playlist Management
*   **Seed Sources:** The AI will seed its candidate tracks from three primary sources:
    1.  The user's Spotify `recently-played` history.
    2.  User-specified favorite **genres and artists**.
    3.  User-linked favorite **Spotify playlists**.
*   **Playlist Structure:** A two-tier system will be used:
    *   **Master Lists:** Large, persistent lists of up to 100 songs for each workout phase (Warm-up, Main, etc.).
    *   **Session Playlist:** A smaller, dynamic playlist generated from the Master Lists for a specific workout.

### 6.2. User Experience & Controls
*   **Pre-Workout Preview:** Users must be able to view and edit the generated "Session Playlist" before starting their workout.
*   **Skip (Soft Delete):** Skipping a song within the **first 30 seconds** removes it from the current *Session Playlist* but keeps it in the *Master List*.
*   **Manual Deletion (Hard Delete):** Users will have an option to permanently remove a song from the *Master List*, which serves as a strong, permanent dislike signal to the AI.
