**As a:** Fitness Enthusiast

**So that:** I can quickly understand my performance trends and stay motivated towards my fitness goals.

## Description

This story covers the implementation of a foundational progress dashboard. The dashboard should display key metrics relevant to the user's fitness journey, allowing them to track their improvements and identify areas for focus.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   **Display Key Metrics:** The dashboard must prominently display at least three core progress metrics (e.g., number of completed workouts, total duration of exercise, average calories burned).
*   **Time-based Overview:** Users should be able to see their progress over predefined periods (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, all time).
*   **Visual Representation:** Basic visual aids (e.g., simple charts or graphs) should be used to represent trends for each metric.
*   **Accessibility:** The dashboard must be easily accessible from the main navigation of the application.
*   **No Data State:** If a user has no historical data, the dashboard should display a clear message indicating this and encourage them to start a workout.
*   **Responsive Design:** The dashboard should be viewable and functional across various device sizes (mobile, tablet).
