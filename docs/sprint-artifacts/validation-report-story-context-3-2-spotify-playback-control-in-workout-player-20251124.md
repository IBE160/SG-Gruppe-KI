## Section Results

### 1. Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
[✓] Story fields are correctly captured.

### 2. Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
[✓] Acceptance criteria match the story draft.

### 3. Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
[✓] Tasks and subtasks are captured as a task list.

### 4. Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
[⚠] Only 3 relevant documentation snippets were included. This is outside the recommended range of 5-15.
Evidence: `<docs>` section contains 3 `<doc>` entries.
Impact: The generated story context is less rich in documentation references than ideal. This might necessitate developers to manually search for project documentation during implementation.

### 5. Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
[✓] No explicit code artifacts are listed, which is acceptable as this is primarily a UI story.

### 6. Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
[✓] Relevant API interfaces are extracted.

### 7. Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
[✓] Applicable development constraints are included.

### 8. Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
[✓] Dependencies are detected and listed for Node.

### 9. Testing standards and locations populated
[✓] Testing standards, locations, and ideas are correctly populated.

### 10. XML structure follows story-context template format

## Failed Items
- None.

## Partial Items
- **Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets**: Only 3 documentation snippets were included, falling short of the recommended 5-15.
  - **Recommendations**: For future context generation, ensure a broader range of relevant documentation is included if available.

## Recommendations
1. **Should Improve**: Review available documentation to include more relevant snippets (5-15 range) for richer context.
