# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 1-4-user-profile-management - User Profile Management
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

(none)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

(none)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- [✗] Change Log initialized
  Evidence: The "Change Log" section was not explicitly present in the story template, and thus not initialized.

## Successes

- Previous Story Continuity: Not applicable as the previous story (1-3) has not yet been drafted.
- Source Document Coverage: All relevant and existing source documents (epics.md, architecture.md) were correctly cited in the story's Dev Notes.
- Requirements Traceability: Acceptance Criteria were accurately extracted from epics.md and match the source.
- Dev Notes Quality: The Dev Notes provided specific guidance with detailed architectural patterns, constraints, source tree components, and testing standards.
- Task-AC Mapping: All tasks clearly reference the Acceptance Criteria, and dedicated testing subtasks are present.
- Story Structure: The story adheres to the "As a / I want / so that" format, its status is "drafted", and the Dev Agent Record sections are correctly initialized.
- Citation Quality: Citations include section names and refer to existing, correct file paths.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: (none)
2. Should Improve: (none)
3. Consider: The "Change Log" section should be initialized in the story template for future tracking of modifications.
