## Failed Items
- None.

## Partial Items
- **Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets.**
  - **Impact:** The generated story context is less rich in documentation references than ideal. This might necessitate developers to manually search for project documentation during implementation.
  - **Explanation:** Only 3 relevant documentation snippets were included. More references to PRD, Tech Spec, and UX Design would be beneficial.

## Recommendations
1.  **Should Improve:** Populate `prd.md`, `tech-spec.md`, `ux-design.md`, and other project documentation to enrich future story contexts.
