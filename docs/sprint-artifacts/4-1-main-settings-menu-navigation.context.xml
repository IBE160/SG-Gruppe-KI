<StoryContext>
  <StorySummary>As a user, I want to access a comprehensive settings menu with categorized options and a search function, so that I can easily find and manage my app preferences.</StorySummary>
  <FrontendContext>This is a frontend-focused story. It involves creating the main settings page, including navigation elements and a search component. A shared layout for all settings pages should be created to ensure a consistent look and feel.</FrontendContext>
  <BackendContext>No new backend development is required for this story. It's purely about client-side presentation and navigation.</BackendContext>
  <DataContext>The list of settings categories can be hardcoded or dynamically loaded from a client-side configuration file for easy maintenance.</DataContext>
  <UXContext>The settings menu should be intuitive and follow common design patterns for navigation. The search functionality is a key usability feature that should provide real-time filtering of the settings categories.</UXContext>
  <Dependencies>
    - Story 1.2 (User Authentication): Requires a logged-in user to access the settings area.
  </Dependencies>
  <Risks>
    - The settings structure might grow complex, making the navigation difficult to maintain. Mitigation: Design a scalable component structure for settings categories and sub-pages.
  </Risks>
  <Assumptions>
    - The initial set of settings categories is defined and stable.
    - The UI/UX designs for the main settings menu (Flow 18, Screen 1) are finalized.
  </Assumptions>
  <TechnicalNotes>
    - Implement a client-side search filter.
    - Use Next.js App Router for creating the settings routes (e.g., `/settings`, `/settings/appearance`).
    - Placeholder pages should be created for each category to ensure navigation works correctly.
