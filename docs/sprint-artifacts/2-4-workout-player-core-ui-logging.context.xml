    <!-- 
    This context file provides the necessary file references for implementing Story 2.4: Workout Player Core UI & Logging.
    The goal is to build the frontend UI for the workout player (Flows 7 & 9), manage its state with Zustand,
    and create a backend API endpoint to incrementally save workout log data to the Supabase database.
