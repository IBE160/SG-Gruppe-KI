feat(architecture): Explicitly define technology versions in architecture document

Addressed critical issues from the architecture validation report by:
- Specifying explicit version numbers for key technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, FastAPI, Python, Supabase clients, OpenAI client) in the "Decision Summary" table.
- Including verification dates and notes on LTS considerations and potential breaking changes.
- Updating the `create-next-next-app` command and Python version in the "Project Initialization" section with specific versions.

This improves clarity for AI agents and future developers, and mitigates risks associated with unspecified "latest" versions.
