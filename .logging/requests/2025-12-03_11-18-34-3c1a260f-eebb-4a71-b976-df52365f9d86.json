Our goal is to achieve high user engagement, long-term retention, and measurable fitness results, fostering a strong brand built on trust and data privacy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Chosen Design System:** shadcn/ui (v0.8.0)\n\n**Rationale:** Selected for its modern, customizable, and headless components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, aligning with the project's technology stack and enabling fast development with great defaults.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n*   **Tailwind CSS Native:** Built to be styled directly with Tailwind, ensuring consistency and flexibility.\n*   **Headless Components:** Provides unstyled components, allowing full control over the visual design.\n*   **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind.\n*   **Customizability:** Highly customizable to fit specific brand guidelines and unique UX requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nThe core defining experience is the **“Adaptive Daily Session”** — a 3-step ritual that combines self-reflection, AI guidance, and performance tracking.\n\n*   **Primary Action:** Users will most often launch their session, provide quick input on energy or mood, and complete an adaptive workout with synchronized music.\n*   **Unique Value:** The app is unique because it merges data (fitness + mood + music) into one adaptive system, creating an experience that’s both efficient and emotionally rewarding.\n*   **Effortless Goal:** It should be delightfully easy for users to open the app, express how they feel, and immediately start training with a session that feels personal, purposeful, and motivating.\n\nUsers should feel **efficient and productive** when using the AI-Powered Personal Training Advisor. This feeling should be so strong that it compels them to recommend the app to friends.\n\n**Platform:** The initial phase will focus on a **web application**, with future plans to expand to **mobile applications**.\n\n### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns\n\n**Pattern Name:** Adaptive Daily Session\n\n**User Goal:** \"One good session that fits how I feel today\" – a workout that matches energy, time, and mood, with synchronized music for flow.\n\n**Trigger:**\n*   **Primary:** A large, friendly card titled “Ready for today?” with a prominent \"[⭐ Start Adaptive Session]\" button on the Dashboard.\n*   **Secondary:** Can also be triggered from a notification (\"Your adaptive session is ready – how are you feeling today?\") or a floating button on the dashboard if the user scrolls.\n\n**Interaction Flow (Ideal):**\n1.  User taps \"Start Adaptive Session\".\n2.  A bottom sheet slides up, presenting a \"Quick Check-In (Context Sheet)\".\n    *   **Question:** “How are you feeling today?”\n    *   **Controls:** Energy slider (Low → Normal → High), Sleep quality (Bad 😴 / Okay 🙂 / Great 😁), a row of chips (Sore legs, Stressed, Motivated, Need it easy, Ready to push), and an optional free-text field (“Anything else I should know?”).\n    *   **Live Feedback:** As the user adjusts sliders/chips, transparent feedback is displayed on the same sheet (e.g., “Got it – I’ll reduce volume ~10% and keep things technique-focused.”). This makes the AI feel collaborative and transparent.\n3.  User taps \"[Generate Today’s Session]\".\n4.  The sheet morphs into a progress state:\n    *   **Text:** “Designing today’s plan…”\n    *   **Micro Status:** “Reading your last 3 sessions… matching music to intensity…”\n    *   **Visual:** A subtle animated icon or progress ring.\n5.  **While AI Works:** Skeleton placeholders for the phase cards (Warm-up, Main, Cooldown) are shown, along with a tagline: “Tuning today’s plan to your energy + music preferences…” This prevents an empty screen experience.\n6.  The loading state transitions into a “Session Ready” screen.\n\n**Success State (\"Session Ready\" Screen):**\n*   **Headline:** “Today’s Adaptive Session is Ready 🎧💪”\n*   **Reason Summary:** A small summary explaining the AI's adaptation (e.g., “Based on: low sleep, sore legs, normal energy. Volume slightly reduced, focus on technique.”).\n*   **Plan Overview Card:** Displays total duration and main focus (e.g., “Upper body push + light accessories”).\n*   **Phase Cards:** Detailed cards for Warm-up, Main sets (exercises + intensity/RPE), and Cooldown (stretches / light cardio).\n*   **Music Row:**\n    *   **If Spotify Connected:** A compact card showing “Session Mix: Power Flow 01” with BPM ranges for each phase (e.g., Warm-up: 100–115 BPM · Main: 135–155 BPM · Cooldown: 90–100 BPM). Includes \"[View Playlist]\" and \"[Change Music]\" buttons.\n    *   **If Spotify Not Connected:** A nudge: “Connect Spotify for adaptive music (optional)” with a \"[Connect Spotify]\" button.\n*   **Action Buttons:** \"[Start Session]\" (primary, drops into Workout Player) and \"[Edit Plan]\" (secondary, allows tweaking exercises or replacing before starting).\n*   **Visual Clarity:** Clearly indicates that the AI has finished, used user context, and that both workout and music are ready.\n\n**Error States (Graceful Handling):**\n*   **Case A: AI Plan Fails (timeout, error, etc.):**\n    *   **Message:** “I couldn’t generate a new plan right now, so I’ve loaded a fallback session based on your recent workouts.”\n    *   **Display:** A card showing a fallback session (e.g., “Last push session (adapted lightly)”) with a short text: “You can start with this or adjust it manually.”\n    *   **Options:** \"[Start Fallback Session]\", \"[Edit Plan]\". Ensures a trainable plan is always available.\n*   **Case B: Music Fails (Spotify not responding / no device / non-premium):**\n    *   **Message:** Plan loads normally, but the music card shows a subtle warning: “Couldn’t start playback on Spotify.”\n    *   **Guidance:** “You can still train – I’ll log skips and likes next time music is available.”\n    *   **Options:** \"[Retry Music]\", \"[Start Session Without Music]\".\n    *   **Non-Premium Adjustment:** “For non-premium accounts, you may not get full on-demand playback. I’ll still learn from your skips and intensity feedback for future sessions.”\n*   **Case C: Offline / No Network:**\n    *   **If Today’s Plan Cached:** “You’re offline, but I’ve loaded your cached plan for today.” \"[Start Session]\".\n    *   **If Nothing Cached:** “You’re offline, so I can’t generate a new AI plan. Here’s a simple offline template based on your last session.” \"[Use Offline Template]\", \"[Try Again]\".\n\n**Deep Exploration of the \"Adaptive Daily Session\" Pattern:**\n\n*   **Similar Patterns & Takeaway:** We will blend Headspace’s calm onboarding, Fitbod’s adaptive transparency, and Spotify’s real-time personalization into one unified ritual.\n*   **Speed:** The goal is \"perceived magic,\" with an ideal interaction time of 5-8 seconds. This will be achieved through pre-fetching data, progressively loading plan details, and using micro-feedback animations to make the process feel alive. A \"Quick Mode\" (one-tap \"Auto-adapt\") will be available for advanced users.\n*   **Delight:** Moments of delight will be created through:\n    *   **Personal Micro-copy:** AI feedback that feels personal (e.g., “You’re fired up! Let’s make it count.”).\n    *   **Haptics:** A subtle haptic pulse when the plan is ready.\n    *   **Dynamic Visuals:** Background motion that matches user input (calm gradients for recovery, brighter tones for high energy).\n    *   **Audio Feedback:** A 2-3 second music preview snippet that fades in as the workout appears.\n*   **Platform Differences:**\n    *   **Mobile:** An immersive ritual with gesture-based flow, a persistent mini-player, and native haptics.\n    *   **Desktop:** A command center for review and adjustments, featuring a wider layout, a contextual side panel for AI reasoning, and keyboard shortcuts.\n*   **Shareability:** A \"Session Card\" will be generated post-workout, creating a socially showable summary of the session's adaptive nature. This card will include a mood summary, visualized progress, and playlist info, with one-tap sharing to social platforms.\n\n### 2.3 Core Experience Principles\n\n*   **Speed: Perceived Magic** - The core flow from check-in to session start should feel almost instantaneous (under 8 seconds), prioritizing a sense of effortless momentum.\n*   **Guidance: Transparent Partnership** - The AI should guide users with clear, collaborative feedback, acting as a transparent partner rather than a black box. We'll provide strong guidance while explaining the \"why.\"\n*   **Flexibility: Simple by Default, Controllable on Demand** - The primary path will be simple and streamlined. However, users will always have an \"Edit Plan\" escape hatch for moments when they want more control.\n*   **Feedback: Personal & Resonant** - Feedback will be both subtle (live updates, haptics) and celebratory (delightful micro-copy, music snippets), making the experience feel personal and emotionally engaging.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Visual Foundation\n\n### 3.1 Color System\n\n**Chosen Theme:** Flow (Dynamic & Personal)\n\n**Rationale:** This theme, inspired by Spotify's personalization, aligns with the core principle of a personal and adaptive experience. The dynamic primary color offers the future possibility of adapting to user mood or workout intensity.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   **Primary:** `#7C3AED` (Purple) - Used for primary actions, active states, and key highlights.\n*   **Secondary:** `#E2E8F0` (Light Gray) - Used for secondary buttons and UI elements.\n*   **Success:** `#16A34A` (Green) - Used for success messages and positive feedback.\n*   **Warning:** `#FBBF24` (Yellow) - Used for non-critical warnings and alerts.\n*   **Destructive:** `#DC2626` (Red) - Used for destructive actions like deleting data.\n*   **Background:** `#FFFFFF` (White) - Clean, airy background for the main content area.\n*   **Text:** `#111827` (Near Black) - High contrast for readability.\n\n#### Dark Color Palette\n\nThe dark theme is designed to provide a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments while maintaining visual consistency with the light theme. Key colors are inverted or adjusted to ensure accessibility and readability.\n\n**Color Palette (Dark Mode - HSL Values):**\n*   **Background:** `224 71% 4%` - Dark, desaturated background for primary content areas.\n*   **Foreground (Text):** `210 40% 98%` - Light, high-contrast text for readability against dark backgrounds.\n*   **Muted:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Slightly lighter dark for secondary backgrounds and inactive states.\n*   **Muted Foreground:** `217.9 10.6% 64.5%` - Desaturated light gray for muted text.\n*   **Popover:** `224 71% 4%` - Matches background for consistency in overlay elements.\n*   **Popover Foreground:** `210 40% 98%` - Matches foreground for text in overlay elements.\n*   **Border:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Subtle dark border for UI separation.\n*   **Input:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Dark input fields.\n*   **Card:** `224 71% 4%` - Dark card backgrounds.\n*   **Card Foreground:** `210 40% 98%` - Light text on cards.\n*   **Primary:** `260 70% 70%` - A vibrant purple that stands out against the dark background, maintaining brand identity.\n*   **Primary Foreground:** `224 71% 4%` - Dark text on primary elements.\n*   **Secondary:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Subtle dark for secondary actions.\n*   **Secondary Foreground:** `210 40% 98%` - Light text on secondary elements.\n*   **Accent:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Dark accent color.\n*   **Accent Foreground:** `210 40% 98%` - Light text on accent elements.\n*   **Destructive:** `0 63% 31%` - Darker red for destructive actions.\n*   **Destructive Foreground:** `210 40% 98%` - Light text on destructive elements.\n*   **Ring:** `215 27.9% 16.3%` - Focus ring color for interactive elements.\n\n#### Color Accessibility\n\nA contrast check was performed to ensure the palette meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n*   **Text on Background (`#111827` on `#FFFFFF`):** The contrast ratio is **16.24:1**, which exceeds the 4.5:1 requirement for normal text. **(Pass)**\n*   **Initial Primary Color (`#8B5CF6` with white text):** The initial primary color had a contrast ratio of 4.11:1, failing the 4.5:1 requirement.\n*   **Updated Primary Color (`#7C3AED` with white text):** The primary color was darkened slightly to `#7C3AED`. It has a contrast ratio of **5.26:1**, which passes the AA standard for normal text. This ensures primary buttons and links are accessible.\n\n### 3.2 Typography\n\n**Font Families:**\n*   **Headings & Body:** System UI Sans-Serif (e.g., -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto) for a clean, modern, and platform-native feel.\n*   **Monospace:** System UI Monospace (e.g., \"SF Mono\", \"Fira Code\", \"Roboto Mono\") for displaying code or data snippets if needed.\n\n*   **Type Scale:** A standard, responsive typographic scale will be used to ensure clear hierarchy and readability across devices. Font weights will be used to differentiate between headings, body text, and labels.\n    *   **H1:** `3.052rem` (48.83px) - Bold, for primary page titles.\n    *   **H2:** `2.441rem` (39.06px) - Bold, for major section headings.\n    *   **H3:** `1.953rem` (31.25px) - Semibold, for sub-section headings.\n    *   **H4:** `1.563rem` (25px) - Medium, for card titles or prominent labels.\n    *   **H5:** `1.25rem` (20px) - Regular, for smaller titles or emphasized text.\n    *   **H6:** `1rem` (16px) - Regular, for minor headings or sub-labels.\n    *   **Body:** `1rem` (16px) - Regular, for standard paragraph text.\n    *   **Small:** `0.8rem` (12.8px) - Regular, for legal text, captions, or less prominent information.\n\n    *   **Line Heights:**\n        *   **Body Text:** `1.5rem` (24px for 16px base) for improved readability.\n        *   **Headings:** `1.25rem` (20px for 16px base) for a more compact and impactful look.\n\n*   **Font Weights:**\n    *   **Bold (700):** Used for `H1`, `H2` to convey strong hierarchy and importance.\n    *   **Semibold (600):** Used for `H3` and key interactive elements (buttons, primary links) to add emphasis.\n    *   **Medium (500):** Used for `H4` and certain UI labels where moderate emphasis is needed.\n    *   **Regular (400):** Default for `H5`, `H6`, body text, and most UI elements to maintain readability.\n    *   **Light (300):** Sparingly used for aesthetic effect or less prominent secondary information.\n### 3.3 Spacing and Layout\n\n*   **Base Unit:** An 8px base unit will be used for all spacing and sizing, ensuring consistency and a harmonious rhythm throughout the UI. This corresponds to the `0.5rem` unit in Tailwind CSS.\n*   **Spacing Scale:** The standard Tailwind CSS spacing scale will be used for margins, padding, and gaps.\n*   **Layout Grid:** A 12-column grid system will be used for the main layout, providing flexibility for responsive design.\n*   **Container Widths:** Standard responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) will be used to control container widths and adapt the layout to different screen sizes.\n\n\n**Interactive Visualizations:**\n\n- Color Theme Explorer: [ux-color-themes.html](./ux-color-themes.html)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Design Direction\n\n### 4.1 Chosen Design Approach\n\n**Chosen Direction:** #2 - Data-Driven Dashboard\n\n**Rationale:** This direction was selected because it aligns with the goal of making progress measurable and motivating. It puts key stats like weekly volume and current streak front and center, which is highly effective for users who are motivated by tracking their performance and seeing tangible results.\n\n**Layout Decisions:**\n*   **Navigation Pattern:** A primary sidebar navigation will be used for the web application to provide clear access to all sections of the app.\n*   **Content Structure:** A multi-column grid will be used to organize content on the dashboard.\n*   **Content Organization:** Content will be organized into cards, with a dedicated main card for the primary \"Start Adaptive Session\" action.\n\n**Hierarchy Decisions:**\n*   **Visual Density:** The dashboard will be information-dense, providing key data at a glance without feeling cluttered.\n*   **Header Emphasis:** Card headers will be bold to provide clear sectioning.\n*   **Content Focus:** The primary focus will be on data-driven elements like stats and progress indicators.\n\n**Interaction Decisions:**\n*   **Primary Action Pattern:** The primary action will be housed in a dedicated, prominent card on the dashboard.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Key performance indicators will be visible at all times on the dashboard.\n\n**Visual Style Decisions:**\n*   **Weight:** The visual style will be balanced, with clear structure and moderate visual weight.\n*   **Depth Cues:** Cards will have a subtle elevation (box-shadow) to lift them off the background.\n*   **Border Style:** Cards will use subtle borders to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.\n\n**Interactive Mockups:**\n\n- Design Direction Showcase: [ux-design-directions.html](./ux-design-directions.html)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Visual Design Direction from Stich\n\nBased on a review of the design explorations in the `docs/stich_design` folder, the following visual design direction has been selected. This direction aligns with the \"Data-Driven Dashboard\" approach and the \"Flow\" color theme.\n\n### Dashboard\n\nThe dashboard will be the central hub of the application, providing users with a quick overview of their progress and a clear starting point for their daily workout. The design is based on `daily_dashboard_1` and `daily_dashboard_2` from the `stich_design` folder.\n\n**Light Theme:**\n![Light Theme Dashboard](./stich_design/daily_dashboard_2/screen.png)\n\n**Dark Theme:**\n![Dark Theme Dashboard](./stich_design/daily_dashboard_1/screen.png)\n\n### Onboarding\n\nThe onboarding flow will be a conversational experience designed to gather information about the user's goals and preferences. The design is based on the `conversational_check-in` and `first_plan_reveal` screens from the `stich_design` folder.\n\n*(More details on the onboarding flow will be added in the User Journey Flows section.)*\n\n---\n\n## 6. User Journey Flows\n\n### 5.1 Critical User Paths\n\n#### User Journey: First-Time User Onboarding\n\n**User Goal:** Help a new user feel personally seen and supported within 2–3 minutes — ending with their first adaptive, personalized workout plan ready to start.\n\n**Approach:** Pure Conversational (Adaptive Dialogue)\n\n**Flow Steps:**\n\n1.  **Warm Welcome (Emotional Hook)**\n    *   **User sees:** Full-screen hero card: “Hey, I’m your AI Training Advisor 👋” “I’ll help you train smarter — not harder. Let’s get your plan set up together.” Below it: “Let’s Begin” button, Subtext: “Takes about 2 minutes. You can edit everything later.”\n    *   **User does:** Taps “Let’s Begin”.\n    *   **System responds:** Transitions to Conversational Check-In.\n\n2.  **Conversational Check-In (Adaptive Dialogue)**\n    *   **User sees:** Chat bubbles from AI.\n        *   AI: “What brings you here today?” -> Chips: 🏋️ Build strength, 🔥 Get lean, 🎯 Stay consistent, 🎯 Performance goal.\n        *   AI: “Nice. How many days a week can you realistically train?” -> Slider input: 1–7 days.\n        *   AI: “Do you have access to any equipment?” -> Checkbox chips: Dumbbells, Barbell, Bench, Resistance bands, Bodyweight only.\n        *   AI: “Perfect. Any injuries or movement limitations I should know about?” -> Text input (optional).\n        *   AI: “Almost done — what kind of music keeps you moving?” -> Chips + mini album previews (if Spotify connected): Energetic, Focus beats, Calm & steady, Surprise me.\n        *   AI: “Got it. I’m tuning your first plan…” -> Subtle animation starts.\n    *   **User does:** Selects chips, uses slider, types text, selects music preferences.\n    *   **System responds:** Displays next AI chat bubble/question.\n\n3.  **Instant AI Feedback (Transparency Moment)**\n    *   **User sees:** \"Thinking sequence\": “Checking recovery profile…”, “Balancing intensity for your 3-day schedule…”, “Syncing with your music preferences…” Subtle animation.\n    *   **User does:** Waits.\n    *   **System responds:** Transitions smoothly to the First Plan Reveal screen.\n\n4.  **The First Plan Reveal**\n    *   **User sees:** Celebratory screen: 🎉 Your First Adaptive Plan Is Ready! Below: Compact summary card (Goal, Schedule, Equipment, Focus Today). Buttons: [View My Plan] (Primary), [Adjust Details] (Secondary).\n    *   **User does:** Taps “View My Plan”.\n    *   **System responds:** Transitions to Workout Player Preview in “Guided Mode”.\n\n5.  **Guided First Workout Preview**\n    *   **User sees:** Workout Player Preview in “Guided Mode”. AI narrates a short walk-through: “Here’s how your session works. Each exercise is explained, and I’ll track your progress as you go.” “Whenever you train, I’ll adapt your next session automatically.”\n    *   **User does:** Listens to narration.\n    *   **System responds:** Presents \"Start Workout\" button.\n\n6.  **After Completion – “The Loop” (Post-Workout)**\n    *   **User sees:** AI recap: “Nice job, Robert. I’ve logged your session and adjusted tomorrow’s recovery plan.” “Want me to remind you when it’s time for your next session?” Buttons: [Yes] [Maybe later].\n    *   **User does:** Selects reminder preference.\n    *   **System responds:** Confirms reminder setting.\n\n**Mermaid Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User opens app] --> B{Warm Welcome Screen};\n    B -- Tap \"Let's Begin\" --> C{Conversational Check-In};\n    C -- User provides input --> D{AI Processing / Thinking Sequence};\n    D -- Plan Generated --> E{First Plan Reveal Screen};\n    E -- Tap \"View My Plan\" --> F{Workout Player Preview (Guided Mode)};\n    F -- User starts workout --> G[Workout Session];\n    G -- Session Completed --> H{Post-Workout Recap / \"The Loop\"};\n```\n\n#### User Journey: Daily Workout Experience\n\n**User Goal:** Make each workout feel intelligently adapted, emotionally attuned, and effortless to begin — transforming “checking in” into a motivational ritual.\n\n**Approach:** Conversational & Adaptive Ritual\n\n**Flow Steps:**\n\n1.  **Daily Launch (Ritual Entry Point):** User opens the app or taps a notification. They see a prominent \"Adaptive Session: Ready\" tile on the dashboard and tap it to open the Context Window.\n2.  **Context Window (Emotional Calibration):** The user interacts with a half-screen modal, providing input on mood, sleep, energy, etc., in a conversational flow.\n3.  **AI Plan Review (Transparency + Trust):** The modal transitions to a Plan Summary. The user sees AI feedback copy explaining the adaptations, a workout overview, session breakdown, and music preview. They can adjust the plan, regenerate it, or ask \"Why this plan?\".\n4.  **Adjustment Interaction (Co-Creation):** If the user requests a change (e.g., \"make it shorter\"), the plan reflows dynamically with clear feedback.\n5.  **Live Workout Mode (Immersive Flow):** The user taps \"Start Workout,\" and the view transitions to the Workout Player with a timer, set tracker, and synced music.\n6.  **Post-Session Reflection (Closure Loop):** After finishing, the user sees an AI feedback summary and provides their own feedback (\"Felt great,\" \"Too much\"). An optional \"Session Card\" is generated for sharing.\n\n**Mermaid Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User opens app / Taps notification] --> B{Dashboard with \"Adaptive Session: Ready\" tile};\n    B -- Tap to start --> C{Context Window (Emotional Calibration)};\n    C -- User provides input --> D{AI Plan Review (Transparency + Trust)};\n    D -- User adjusts plan --> D;\n    D -- Tap \"Start Workout\" --> E{Live Workout Mode};\n    E -- Session Completed --> F{Post-Session Reflection (Closure Loop)};\n    F -- User provides feedback --> G[Personalization Model Updated];\n    F -- User shares --> H[Session Card Generated];\n```\n\n#### User Journey: Managing Settings and Preferences\n\n**User Goal:** To easily customize the app experience and manage personal data in a way that feels clear, simple, and trustworthy.\n\n**Approach:** A main settings screen with clear categories that navigate to focused sub-pages.\n\n**Flow Steps:**\n\n1.  **Navigate to Settings:** The user clicks a \"Settings\" or profile icon in the main navigation to access the main Settings screen.\n2.  **Explore Categories:** The user sees a list of categories (e.g., General, Appearance, Music & Playback, Privacy & Account) and taps one to navigate to its dedicated sub-page.\n3.  **Apply Changes:** On a sub-page, the user interacts with controls (toggles, sliders, etc.). Changes are applied instantly with visual feedback and a confirmation toast.\n4.  **Data Management:** On the \"Privacy & Account\" sub-page, the user can initiate data export or account deletion. Destructive actions like account deletion require a confirmation modal where the user must type \"DELETE\" to proceed.\n\n**Mermaid Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User clicks \"Settings\" in main nav] --> B{Main Settings Screen (Categories)};\n    B -- Taps \"Appearance\" --> C{Appearance Sub-Page};\n    C -- Changes theme --> C;\n    C -- Navigates back --> B;\n    B -- Taps \"Privacy & Account\" --> D{Privacy & Account Sub-Page};\n    D -- Taps \"Delete Account\" --> E{Confirmation Modal};\n    E -- Confirms deletion --> F[Account Deletion Process];\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Component Library\n\n### 6.1 Component Strategy\n\nThe component strategy will leverage `shadcn/ui` as the foundational library, providing a set of accessible and customizable headless components.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n*   **Composition over Configuration:** Prioritize composing smaller, single-purpose components from `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS utilities to build more complex UI elements.\n*   **Customization:** All components will be styled using Tailwind CSS, allowing for easy theming and adherence to the defined visual foundation (color, typography, spacing).\n*   **Accessibility First:** Inherit accessibility features from `shadcn/ui` and ensure any custom components or modifications maintain or enhance accessibility standards.\n*   **Reusability:** Develop custom components only when `shadcn/ui` does not offer a suitable base or when highly specific application logic is required. These custom components will be designed for maximum reusability across the application.\n\n**Component Categories:**\n1.  **Base Components (shadcn/ui):** Buttons, Inputs, Modals, Cards, Navigation elements, etc., customized with project-specific styling.\n2.  **Composite Components (Application-Specific):** Combinations of base components forming larger UI blocks, such as the \"Adaptive Session Card,\" \"Workout Player Controls,\" or \"Context Check-In Form.\" These will encapsulate specific application logic and data display.\n3.  **Utility Components:** Small, focused components for common UI patterns not covered by `shadcn/ui` (e.g., specific icons, loaders, or micro-interaction elements).\n\n**Documentation:** All custom and significantly customized components will be documented with their purpose, props, states, and usage examples to facilitate consistent development and future maintenance.\n\n**Custom Component State Specifications (General):**\nFor all custom components, the following states should be considered and implemented:\n*   **Default:** Standard appearance and behavior.\n*   **Hover:** Visual feedback when a user's pointer is over the component.\n*   **Active/Pressed:** Visual feedback when a user interacts with the component (e.g., button click).\n*   **Loading:** Indication that data is being fetched or an operation is in progress (e.g., spinner, skeleton).\n*   **Error:** Visual feedback when an error occurs (e.g., invalid input, failed action, red border).\n*   **Disabled:** Visual and interactive state indicating the component is not currently usable.\n\n**Custom Component Variant Specifications (General):**\nCustom components should consider the following variants:\n*   **Sizes:** Small, Medium (default), Large – affecting padding, font sizes, and overall dimensions.\n*   **Styles:** Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Outline – aligning with button hierarchy and visual weight.\n*   **Layouts:** Different arrangements of internal elements, especially for composite components (e.g., card with horizontal vs. vertical content).\n\n**Custom Component Content/Data Specifications (General):**\n*   For each custom component, clearly define the data structure and content elements it is expected to display.\n*   Specify how data inputs map to visual elements (e.g., `workout.name` to component title).\n*   Indicate any conditional rendering based on data availability or state.\n\n**Custom Component User Action Specifications (General):**\n*   List all interactive elements within the custom component (e.g., buttons, links, toggles).\n*   For each interactive element, describe the expected user action (e.g., click, hover, drag) and the system response.\n*   Specify any validation rules or feedback related to user input.\n\n**Custom Component Accessibility Considerations (General):**\n*   **ARIA Attributes:** Identify specific ARIA roles, states, and properties needed for complex interactions within the component.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure logical tab order and full keyboard operability for all interactive elements.\n*   **Screen Reader Text:** Provide clear and concise labels or descriptive text for screen readers where visual context is insufficient.\n*   **Focus Management:** Manage focus appropriately for dynamic content, modals, or interactive regions.\n*   **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements within the component.\n\n### Detailed Custom Component Specifications Guidance:\nFor each custom component identified, a dedicated specification (either as a separate document or a distinct section within the overall UX Spec) should be created. This individual specification must detail the following, building upon the general guidelines provided above:\n\n*   **1. Purpose and User-Facing Value:** Clearly define what the component does and its benefit to the user.\n*   **2. Content and Data Structure:**\n    *   Precisely define all data inputs (props) the component accepts, including data types, examples, and whether they are required or optional.\n    *   Detail the mapping of data to specific visual elements within the component.\n    *   Specify any internal data transformations or derivations.\n    *   Describe content limitations (e.g., max characters, supported formats).\n*   **3. User Actions and Behaviors:**\n    *   Enumerate all interactive elements within the component (e.g., buttons, links, input fields, draggable areas).\n    *   For each interactive element, define:\n        *   The specific user input (e.g., click, hover, drag start, text input).\n        *   The immediate visual feedback.\n        *   The resulting system action or event emitted.\n    *   Specify validation rules for inputs and corresponding error feedback.\n    *   Define complex behaviors (e.g., drag-and-drop logic, multi-step interactions).\n*   **4. States:**\n    *   Illustrate all possible visual and interactive states, including:\n        *   **Default:** Standard appearance.\n        *   **Hover:** How it looks when a pointer is over it.\n        *   **Focus:** How it looks when it receives keyboard focus.\n        *   **Active/Pressed:** How it looks when being activated.\n        *   **Loading:** Visuals indicating data fetch or processing.\n        *   **Empty:** What is displayed when there's no data.\n        *   **Error:** Visuals and messages when an error occurs.\n        *   **Disabled:** How it looks and behaves when inactive.\n        *   **Success/Warning (if applicable):** Specific semantic states.\n    *   Provide visual examples or descriptions for each state.\n*   **5. Variants:**\n    *   Document all defined variations of the component, including:\n        *   **Sizes:** Small, Medium, Large, and their specific dimensions/paddings.\n        *   **Styles:** Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Outline, and any other distinct visual themes.\n        *   **Layouts:** How the internal elements rearrange for different configurations (e.g., icon position, text wrapping).\n    *   Specify when each variant should be used.\n*   **6. Accessibility Considerations:**\n    *   Detail specific ARIA roles, states, and properties required for the component.\n    *   Outline the keyboard navigation order and expected interactions.\n    *   Specify screen reader text for complex elements or those without visible labels.\n    *   Address color contrast for all text and interactive elements within the component.\n    *   Describe focus management for dynamic content or popovers.\n*   **7. Responsive Behavior:**\n    *   Define how the component adapts across different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).\n    *   Specify layout changes, font size adjustments, and interactive element modifications for each breakpoint.\n*   **8. Performance Considerations:**\n    *   Note any specific performance requirements or optimizations related to the component (e.g., virtualization for long lists).\n\n---\n\n## 9. UX Pattern Decisions\n\n### 9.1 Consistency Rules\n\nThe following UX patterns establish consistent interaction and visual language across the application. Each pattern includes its specification, usage guidance, and examples.\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**Specification:** Buttons are categorized by their prominence and intended action, guiding users to primary tasks while providing options for secondary and tertiary actions.\n\n*   **Primary Button:** Used for the most important action on a screen or within a flow. High visual weight.\n    *   **Appearance:** Solid fill with primary brand color.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Start Session\", \"Generate Today's Plan\", \"Save Changes\".\n*   **Secondary Button:** Used for important but not primary actions. Moderate visual weight.\n    *   **Appearance:** Outline with primary brand color or solid fill with secondary color.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Edit Plan\", \"View Playlist\", \"Cancel\".\n*   **Tertiary Button (Ghost/Text Button):** Used for less prominent actions, often within a group of related actions or for navigation. Low visual weight.\n    *   **Appearance:** Text-only or minimal background.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Change Music\", \"Why this plan?\", \"Learn More\".\n*   **Destructive Button:** Used for actions that result in irreversible data loss or significant changes.\n    *   **Appearance:** Solid fill with destructive brand color (red).\n    *   **Usage:** \"Delete Account\", \"Remove Item\".\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Limit primary buttons to one per screen or primary action flow to maintain focus.\n*   Ensure sufficient visual contrast between button types.\n*   Use clear, action-oriented labels.\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Consistent visual and textual cues to inform users about the system's status, success of actions, errors, warnings, and informational messages.\n\n*   **Success Message:** Confirms a user's action was completed successfully.\n    *   **Appearance:** Green-themed toast or inline message.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Plan saved successfully!\", \"Workout logged.\"\n*   **Error Message:** Informs the user that an action failed or an issue occurred.\n    *   **Appearance:** Red-themed toast or inline message, often with an icon.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Failed to generate plan. Please try again.\", \"Invalid input.\"\n*   **Warning Message:** Alerts the user to potential issues or consequences that are not critical errors but require attention.\n    *   **Appearance:** Yellow-themed toast or inline message, often with an icon.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Spotify connection lost. Music playback may be interrupted.\", \"Changes not saved.\"\n*   **Info Message:** Provides general information or context to the user.\n    *   **Appearance:** Blue/gray-themed toast or inline message.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Your plan has been adapted based on your mood.\", \"New features available!\"\n*   **Loading State:** Indicates that the system is processing an action or fetching data.\n    *   **Appearance:** Spinners, progress bars, skeleton screens.\n    *   **Usage:** \"Designing today's plan...\", \"Loading your profile.\"\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Provide immediate feedback for all user interactions.\n*   Messages should be concise, clear, and actionable where appropriate.\n*   Use non-modal feedback (toasts, inline messages) for non-critical information to avoid interrupting the user flow.\n*   For critical errors requiring user intervention, use modal dialogs.\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Guidelines for the design and behavior of input fields, labels, validation, and error handling within forms to ensure clarity and ease of use.\n\n*   **Labels:** Always use clear, concise, and persistent labels above or to the left of input fields.\n*   **Input Fields:** Standardized styles for text inputs, text areas, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons.\n*   **Validation:** Real-time validation feedback where possible, indicating valid or invalid input as the user types.\n*   **Error Handling:** Clear, specific error messages displayed inline with the problematic field, explaining the issue and suggesting a solution.\n*   **Help Text:** Provide contextual help text below input fields for complex or unfamiliar inputs.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Group related form fields logically.\n*   Minimize the number of required fields.\n*   Provide clear visual hierarchy for form elements.\n\n### Modal Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Rules for the appearance, behavior, and interaction of modal dialogs, ensuring they are used appropriately and do not disrupt user flow unnecessarily.\n\n*   **Types:**\n    *   **Standard Modal:** For focused tasks or critical information.\n    *   **Bottom Sheet Modal:** For quick check-ins or contextual actions on mobile.\n*   **Dismissal:** Clear close button (X icon), and typically dismissible by clicking outside the modal or pressing ESC. Critical modals may require explicit action.\n*   **Focus Management:** Focus should be trapped within the modal when open and returned to the trigger element upon close.\n*   **Stacking:** Avoid stacking multiple modals. If a sub-task requires another modal, consider a different interaction pattern.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Use sparingly for essential interactions that require user attention.\n*   Ensure content within modals is concise and directly related to the modal's purpose.\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Defines how users move through the application, ensuring discoverability, consistency, and efficiency.\n\n*   **Primary Navigation:**\n    *   **Web/Desktop:** Persistent left sidebar navigation for main sections.\n    *   **Mobile:** Bottom navigation bar for primary app sections.\n*   **Secondary Navigation:** Contextual tabs or sub-menus for navigating within a main section.\n*   **Active State:** Clearly indicate the currently active navigation item.\n*   **Breadcrumbs:** Use breadcrumbs for complex hierarchical structures to show the user's current location.\n*   **Back Button:** Consistent placement and behavior for navigating back within a flow or hierarchy.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Keep navigation structure shallow and intuitive.\n*   Prioritize frequently accessed sections in primary navigation.\n\n### Empty State Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Design for screens or components that currently have no content, providing guidance and encouraging user action.\n\n*   **First Use:** Welcome messages with clear calls to action to get started.\n*   **No Results:** Informative messages when a search or filter yields no results, with suggestions for alternative actions.\n*   **Cleared Content:** Messages indicating content has been cleared, with options to undo or re-add.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Be helpful and encouraging, not accusatory.\n*   Include a clear call to action relevant to the empty state.\n\n### Confirmation Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Guidelines for requesting user confirmation before executing potentially irreversible or significant actions.\n\n*   **Destructive Actions:** Use a modal dialog requiring explicit confirmation (e.g., typing \"DELETE\").\n*   **Non-Destructive but Significant Actions:** Use a simple confirmation dialog or a toast with an \"Undo\" option.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Clearly state the action being confirmed and its consequences.\n*   Provide distinct options for confirming and canceling.\n\n### Notification Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Rules for delivering timely and relevant information to users without being overly intrusive.\n\n*   **Types:**\n    *   **Toast Notifications:** Ephemeral messages for non-critical, time-sensitive feedback.\n    *   **In-App Notifications:** Persistent notifications within a dedicated notification center.\n    *   **Push Notifications:** For critical, time-sensitive information outside the app (with user permission).\n*   **Placement:** Toasts typically appear at the top or bottom of the screen, disappearing after a short duration.\n*   **Duration:**\n    *   **Transient (Toast):** Visible for 3-5 seconds, then fades out. User can dismiss manually.\n    *   **Persistent (In-App/Push):** Remains until explicitly dismissed by the user or action is taken.\n*   **Stacking:**\n    *   **Toast Notifications:** Max 3 toasts visible at any given time. New toasts push older ones up, with the oldest disappearing if the limit is reached.\n    *   **In-App Notifications:** Displayed in a dedicated notification center, stacked chronologically.\n*   **Priority:** Critical notifications should be visually distinct and potentially interruptive (e.g., modal for urgent alerts).\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Be concise and direct.\n*   Allow users to control notification preferences.\n\n### Search Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Defines the interaction model for searching within the application, ensuring efficiency and clear results.\n\n*   **Search Input:** Prominent search bar or icon that expands to a search bar.\n*   **Real-time Results:** Display results as the user types (search-as-you-type).\n*   **Filters/Sorting:** Provide options to refine search results.\n*   **No Results State:** Clear feedback and suggestions when no matches are found.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Place search where users expect to find it.\n*   Optimize search for speed and relevance.\n\n### Date/Time Patterns\n\n**Specification:** Standardized formats and interaction models for displaying and inputting dates and times.\n\n*   **Display Format:** Consistent date and time formats (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"HH:MM AM/PM\").\n*   **Time Zones:** Clearly indicate time zones when relevant.\n*   **Date Pickers:** Use intuitive date picker components for selecting dates.\n*   **Time Pickers:** Use intuitive time picker components for selecting times.\n\n**Usage Guidance:**\n*   Use locale-appropriate formats where possible.\n*   Provide clear instructions for date/time input.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### 10.1 Responsive Strategy\n\n**Goal:** Ensure the app delivers a smooth, adaptive experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop — starting web-first with future mobile-native expansion.\n\n**Breakpoints (Tailwind / General):**\n*   **Mobile first:** 0–639 px (default)\n*   **Tablet:** 640–1023 px (sm / md)\n*   **Desktop:** ≥1024 px (lg+)\n\n**Principles:** Design mobile-first, scale up. Max content width on desktop ≈ 1200–1280 px for readability. The primary action (“Start Today’s Session” / “Generate Plan”) must always appear above the fold on every device.\n\n**Dashboard & Navigation:**\n*   **Mobile:** Bottom nav bar with 4–5 icons (Home, Workout, History, Music, Settings). Single-column vertical scroll: “Today’s Plan” card → CTA, Context Check-In card, Progress / streak summary. Large tappable cards (≥ 44 × 44 px targets).\n*   **Tablet / Desktop:** Left sidebar navigation + content area. Dashboard uses 2–3 columns: Col 1 – Today + Context; Col 2 – Progress / analytics; Col 3 – Music / AI status (optional ≥ xl).\n\n**Context Window (Adaptive Daily Session):**\n*   **Mobile:** Bottom-sheet modal sliding up; step-by-step inputs (mood, energy, notes). Sticky CTA button: “Apply to Today’s Plan.”\n*   **Desktop:** Sticky right-side panel, collapsible to icon bar. Use minimal text + emoji/slider UI for emotional tone.\n\n**Workout Player:**\n*   **Mobile:** Full-focus view for one task at a time. Header: session name + phase progress. Middle: active exercise block. Footer: main controls (Complete, Timer, Skip, Music). Compact “Now Playing” bar above footer.\n*   **Desktop / Tablet:** Split layout: Left: exercise list; Center: active exercise + logging; Right: metrics (heart rate / music / context notes).\n\n**Music & Smart Radio:**\n*   **Mobile:** Persistent mini player at bottom; expands to full view on tap. Always one-thumb operation.\n*   **Desktop:** Dedicated side widget/card.\n\n**Settings & Forms:**\n*   **Mobile:** Single column list with collapsible sections (accordions).\n*   **Desktop:** Left menu for categories → right panel for content.\n*   **Long forms (onboarding):** Multi-step wizards with progress bar.\n\n### 10.2 Accessibility\n\n**Goal:** To ensure the AI-Powered Personal Training Advisor is usable by the widest possible audience, including individuals with disabilities, adhering to established accessibility standards.\n\n**WCAG Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 AA\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n*   **Color Contrast:** All text and essential UI components will meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, as per WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. Tools will be used during design and development to verify compliance.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields, navigation items) will be fully navigable and operable using only a keyboard. The tab order will be logical and intuitive.\n*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear and visible focus indicators will be provided for all interactive elements when they receive keyboard focus. These indicators will meet color contrast requirements.\n*   **ARIA Requirements:** Appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties will be used to convey meaning and structure to assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers). This includes proper labeling of form fields, status messages, and interactive controls.\n*   **Screen Reader Considerations:** The application will be structured semantically to ensure screen readers can accurately interpret and convey content and functionality. Meaningful labels, headings, and alternative text will be provided.\n*   **Alt Text Strategy for Images:** All informative images will have descriptive `alt` text. Decorative images will have empty `alt` attributes (`alt=\"\"`). Complex images (e.g., charts, graphs) will have detailed descriptions either in `alt` text or adjacent to the image.\n*   **Form Accessibility:** Form fields will have explicitly associated labels. Validation errors will be clearly communicated to assistive technologies, and users will be guided on how to correct errors.\n*   **Testing Strategy:** Accessibility will be integrated into the development lifecycle. This includes:\n    *   **Automated Testing:** Using tools like Lighthouse, Axe, or similar during development and CI/CD.\n    *   **Manual Testing:** Regular manual checks with keyboard navigation and screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).\n    *   **User Testing:** Involving users with disabilities in usability testing sessions.\n    *   **Comprehensive Auditing:** A plan will be established to systematically audit and verify the accessibility of *every interactive element* throughout the application, ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes documenting audit findings and tracking remediation efforts.\n\n---\n\n## 9.
