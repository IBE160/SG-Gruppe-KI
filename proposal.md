# üí™ Case Title
AI-Powered Personal Training Advisor

---

## üß© Background
Many people struggle to stay consistent with training because they lack a clear daily plan, motivation, and seamless tools.  
Existing apps often separate training, music, coaching, and community ‚Äî making it difficult to build long-term habits.

This project aims to solve that by creating an **AI-assisted training companion** that combines personalized guidance, habit support, **music integration**, and a seamless user experience.

---

## üéØ Purpose
Develop a personal training app that generates **adaptive daily plans with AI**, including:
- Training and recovery tips  
- Motivation and music playback  
- Wearable syncing  
- Progress tracking  

The goal is efficient progress and lasting consistency.

---

## üë• Target Users
- **Beginners** ‚Äì safe, structured day-by-day guidance  
- **Experienced trainees** ‚Äì progression control and periodization  
- **Busy individuals** ‚Äì efficient, flexible workouts  
- **Recreational athletes** ‚Äì data-driven insights through wearables and music feedback

2. User is presented with multiple authentication options:
   - **Continue with Google (OAuth)**
   - **Continue with Apple (OAuth)**
   - **Sign in with Email & Password**
   - **Create Account (Email & Password)**
3. If the user selects Google or Apple, an OAuth flow is initiated ‚Üí on success, user is authenticated.
4. If the user selects ‚ÄúCreate Account‚Äù, they register using email + password ‚Üí system sends an optional verification email.
5. Upon successful login or registration, backend checks whether this is a first-time user.
6. If **new user** ‚Üí a new entry is created in `Users` with fields such as `provider` (`google`, `apple`, or `password`).
7. If **returning user** ‚Üí existing profile is retrieved.
8. First-time users are redirected to **Onboarding**; returning users go directly to the **Dashboard**.

**APIs & Data:**  
- `POST /auth/register` ‚Äì Create account (Email + Password)  
- `POST /auth/login` ‚Äì Manual sign-in  
- `POST /auth/oauth/google` ‚Äì Google OAuth callback

`id`, `email`, `provider('google'|'apple'|'password')`, `email_verified_at`, `createdAt`, `metadata`

**Success Outcome:**  
‚úÖ User is authenticated and redirected either to Onboarding (first-time) or Dashboard (returning).

**Failure / Fallback:**  
‚ùå Invalid email/password ‚Üí error message displayed  
‚ùå Canceled OAuth flow ‚Üí user returns to login screen  
‚ùå Unverified email (manual accounts) ‚Üí prompt to verify or resend link  
‚ùå Network failure ‚Üí retry or fallback to cached session (if available)

1. User selects training goal (e.g., Strength / Fat Loss / Endurance).  
2. User chooses available training time per week and session length.  
3. User selects available equipment (e.g., bodyweight, dumbbells, full gym).  
4. User indicates any injuries or limitations.  
5. User sets unit system (kg/lbs, metric/imperial).  
6. User confirms setup and proceeds to optional integrations.

**APIs & Data:**  
- Stores data in `Goals`: `goal`, `equipment`, `injuries`, `frequency`

---

### ‚úÖ Flow 8 ‚Äì Connect Live Heart Rate (BLE Broadcast)

**Trigger:**  
User taps **‚ÄúConnect Heart Rate‚Äù** inside the Workout Player (optional feature).

**Requirements:**  
- A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) heart rate broadcasting device (e.g., Apple Watch in broadcast mode, Garmin / Polar / Fitbit watches with HR broadcast support, dedicated HR straps such as Polar H10 or Garmin HRM-Pro).  
- Browser or client must support Web Bluetooth (or native BLE on iOS/Android in future native app).

**Steps:**  
1. User taps **‚ÄúConnect Heart Rate‚Äù** in the Workout Player.  
2. The app initiates a device scan for BLE devices exposing the standard **heart_rate** service.  
3. User selects their device from the list (e.g., Garmin, Polar, Apple Watch in broadcast mode).  
4. A live BPM stream begins, typically with a refresh frequency of ‚â•1 Hz.  
5. Heart rate is displayed in real time, including visualized zones/intensity markers.  
6. If **AI Live Coaching** is enabled, the system evaluates HR against thresholds and may trigger real-time cues such as:
   - *‚ÄúHeart rate is too high ‚Äì reduce pace for 60s‚Äù*
   - *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre below target zone ‚Äì increase effort slightly‚Äù*
7. Live HR data may be buffered and stored as part of the active session in `WorkoutLogs` or associated with a specific entry.

**APIs & Data:**  
- Live BLE communication via Web Bluetooth (client-side)  
- Optional: `POST /live/hr` for batching HR logging linked to a session  
- Data stored under:
  - `WorkoutLogs` (session HR trace)
  - or appended to `AppleHealthSamples` (if unified HR sample storage is used)

**Success Outcome:**  
‚úÖ User receives continuous heart rate feedback during the workout, optionally enhanced by real-time AI coaching for optimal pacing or safety.

**Failure / Fallback:**  
‚ùå BLE not supported on the device/browser ‚Üí user is informed and may proceed without HR.  
‚ùå Device not detected or not broadcasting ‚Üí user is prompted to retry or check device settings.  
‚ùå Connection drops mid-session ‚Üí app offers auto-reconnect or ‚ÄúContinue without HR‚Äù option.

### ‚úÖ Flow 11 ‚Äì Generate Session Mix (Optional AI-Based Playlist)

**Trigger:**  
After confirming the AI-generated workout plan or at the end of a session, the user taps **‚ÄúGenerate Session Mix‚Äù** (available only if Spotify is connected).

**Steps:**  
1. User selects a playlist mode:
   - **Warm-up only**
   - **Full session (phased by plan)**
   - **Recovery / cooldown**
2. App extracts BPM targets per workout phase from the active plan.
3. System queries Spotify‚Äôs recommendation engine using:
   - User‚Äôs listening history
   - Preferred genres (if available)
   - BPM range per phase (e.g., warm-up: 100‚Äì120 BPM)
4. A custom playlist is generated and added to the user‚Äôs Spotify account (private or public per user preference).
5. In-app playback controls are enabled (Play / Pause / Next / Device selection).
6. Playlist metadata and BPM associations may be stored to refine future AI-generated mixes.

**APIs & Data:**  
- `GET /music/recently-played`  
- `GET /music/devices`  
- `POST /music/create-playlist` (or equivalent wrapper for Spotify‚Äôs playlist endpoint)  
- `POST /music/play`, `POST /music/pause`  
- Stored in `MusicPreferences` + optional session-specific playlist logs

**Success Outcome:**  
‚úÖ A personalized workout playlist is generated, aligned with intensity phases, and becomes available for immediate playback within the workout session.

**Failure / Fallback:**  
‚ùå User does not have Spotify Premium ‚Üí playback is not available; user may still save the playlist.

2. For cloud-based platforms (Strava, Fit, Garmin, etc.):  
   - System requests new workouts and metrics since the last sync.  
3. For Apple Health (HealthKit):  
   - iOS companion app triggers background delivery or scheduled sync using anchored queries.  
4. Health data (workouts, HR, HRV, sleep, calories) is normalized and mapped to internal schema.  
5. Workouts are merged into `WorkoutSync` and linked to planned sessions when applicable.  
6. HR/HRV/Sleep metrics are stored (e.g., in `AppleHealthSamples` or equivalent tables).
7. AI planning engine incorporates new recovery and training load data (e.g., reduce next day‚Äôs volume after poor sleep/HRV).

**APIs & Data:**  
- `POST /wearables/sync` (Strava / Google Fit / Fitbit / Garmin / Polar / Health Connect)  
- `POST /apple-health/sync/upload` (HealthKit batched sync)  
- Database tables updated:
  - `WorkoutSync` (workout sessions)
  - `AppleHealthSamples` (raw HR/HRV/sleep)
  - `AppleHealthSyncAnchors` (HealthKit sync anchor states)

**Success Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Dashboard and AI-planned workouts reflect the latest activity load and recovery status, enhancing personalization.

**Failure / Fallback:**  
‚ùå Platform-specific rate limit ‚Üí sync is rescheduled or queued.  
‚ùå Offline or connectivity loss ‚Üí sync is retried when connection is restored.  
‚ùå Workout misalignment or duplicate detection issues ‚Üí flagged for user review or manual correction (see Flow 13).
